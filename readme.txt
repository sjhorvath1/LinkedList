Hello and welcome to my singly Linked List. This is a basic Java data structure.It should be noted that positioning in this list is not traditional computer science counting, that is the list positions start at 1. Any attempt to add a node to a zeroth position will result in a null node/list. 

Feel free to e-mail me at 1samuelhorvath@gmail.com with any questions.
